# Prefect Container
This Docker container provides a complete environment for running Prefect workflows.

## Getting started
To use this container, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. Once Docker is installed, you can build the container by running the following command:
```
docker build -t prefect .
```

This will build a Docker image called *prefect* that contains Prefect and all its dependencies.
