# MLflow Container

This Docker container provides a standalone MLflow server that can be used to track machine learning experiments.

## Getting started

To use this container, you will need to have Docker installed on your machine. Once Docker is installed, you can build the container by running the following command:

```
docker build -t mlflow-container .
```

This will build a Docker image called `my-mlflow-container` that contains MLflow.
